# Pokémon Emerald: Seaglass — SuperCard Patch

This patch adapts the Pokémon Emerald: Seaglass ROM hack for compatibility with the GBA SuperCard using SuperFW.

# Requirements

- Pokemon Emerald (USA) clean rom
- Tool to patch IPS (LunarIPS, ...)
- **Working in-game save from known emu (Required!!!!)**

# Notes

- Use already in-game save file from knonw emu (Like setting player name and gender and save in the truck) as the routine to erase chip is not properly implemented yet
- If using SuperFW, don't enable patching as it will patch it as stock Pokemon Emerald rendering the game to not boot

# TODO

- Add RTC support
- Add in game menu to save without rebooting
